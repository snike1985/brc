                    <h2>Heritage</h2>

                    <p>For centuries, the Saratoga region had been a destination for Native Americans who came for the area's natural hot springs, and Saratoga quickly
                        became a hub for settlers, trappers, and loggers in the late 19th century. In 1884, the Sterrett brothers settled the land that would become Brush
                        Creek Ranch and built the original homestead with logs cut, skid, and hauled from the adjacent area which is now part of Medicine Bow National
                        Forest. A spirit of hard work, recreation, adventure and good times shared together are prevalent in the archives of days past at Brush Creek Ranch,
                        from famous barn and campfire cookouts to fishing on the renowned Brush Creek. This heritage is still apparent in the current incarnation of
                        Brush Creek as a luxury guest ranch, and visitors will find that, despite the plethora of modern amenities,</p>

                    <p>Brush Creek is still a working Wyoming ranch at heart. We are honored to have recently acquired the historic the A Cross/Sanger Ranch
                        is known as the “crown jewel” of the Platte River Valley. This historic property expands upon our proud tradition of preserving the authentic
                        American West and sharing it with our guests for generations to come. Brush Creek Ranch has now doubled in size with 30,000 acres, more
                        than 20 miles of private waters and unlimited wide-open spaces for your sporting and outdoor adventures. Together these historic ranchlands
                        under the Brush Creek Ranch collection, including the A Cross/ Sanger Ranch, Upper and Lower Encampment Ranches and TZ Ranch
                        (location of our Magee Homestead). Brush Creek Ranch was first acquired in 2008 by Bruce White, Chairman and CEO of White Lodging,
                        one of the most respected names in the hotel industry and operator of award-winning premium hotel brands across the country. The Lodge
                        & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch is the culmination of the White family’s extensive hospitality experience, continuous dedication to philanthropy
                        and unabashed passion for the sustainability of authentic Western heritage. Their vision unfolds as a refined 30,000-acre getaway that strikes
                        a perfect balance between active outdoor recreation, shared experiences, economic sustainability and preservation of the Western way of life.</p>

                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

                    <p>Ranching has been a sustainable way of life in America's heartland for centuries, and responsible conservation and cultivation of the land
                        continues to endure as the philosophical underpinning of The Lodge and Spa at Brush Creek Ranch. We pride ourselves on offering unforgettable
                        ranch vacations with minimal impact on the environment and, as a working Wyoming ranch, understand that good stewardship of the land will
                        help ensure our ranch will thrive and be enjoyed for generations to come. The Lodge & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch has been recognized as a leader
                        in sustainability among Wyoming guest ranches. With a substantial expanse of land in a conservation easement, our Wyoming guest ranch is
                        committed to harmoniously balancing the needs of wildlife, livestock, the land and watershed through an ongoing land, stream, pond and
